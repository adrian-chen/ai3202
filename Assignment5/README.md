## Author: Adrian Chen

The code can be run using:
```
$ python Markov.py <epsilon> <discount>
```
for example the base case can be run by:
```
$ python Markov.py 0.5 0.9
```

## Question
I found that the path changes with an E value of 20. I tried individual numbers up to 10, and none of these solutions changed the outcome.
